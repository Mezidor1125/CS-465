# Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA)
# Compare And Contrast
Within the front-end development, I utilized Express HTML, JavaScript, and single-page applications (SPA). Express HTML utilizes multiple-web pages with controller and route mechanics to smoothly navigate throughout the environment. Express can utilize JavaScript to make webpages more interactive and immersive. Single-page applications are as they are described, utilizing Angular to construct an interactive and immersive environment. Both can utilize JavaScript 

# NoSQL For Backend
The reason for the NoSQL MongoDB database for the backend is because of the utilization of JSON documents, the flexibility of agile and DevOps practices, the tables are flexible, scaling can be horizontal, and NoSQL does not require ORMs (object-relational mapping) (MongoDB, 2022a, p. 1).

# JSON Vs. JavaScript
JSON and Javascript are different in a few key ways including language dependency, text only, and string vs. object properties (Kazmi, 2022, p. 1). JavaScript objects are completely dependent on Javascript while JSON can be supported on 50 different programming languages (Kazmi, 2022, p. 1). 

# JSON Communication (Frontend And Backend)
JSON utilizes HTTP request/response payloads to create communication scenarios for the front and backend operations within an application (Vsupalov, 2019, p. 1). Whenever a browser utilizes GET or POST actions, JSON can be used to manipulate the interactions between the user and application based on the response provided (Vsupalov, 2019, p. 1).

# Code Refactoring
Code that was refactored to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the application included creating handlebars within the application to perform flexible templates. I also refactored code to utilize in-line procedures to read from the JSON data and allow the ease to customize code/outputs on the front end from the backend of the application.

# Testing
The methods, endpoints, and security in a full-stack application are the structures and foundations to provide an effective and efficient full-stack application. The methods provide the functionality of the application. The endpoints allow for customizable actions within the application (GET, POST, DELETE, etc.). The security can involve authentication and generations of web tokens while utilizing a middleware framework within the application to allow for secure systems within the full-stack application.

# Ending
I am very grateful to have learned so much throughout my time in the course, professor! Take care! Have a great rest of your day! Stay safe!

Sincerely,
Lawrence
