Objective:
The project involves creating a website for a travel booking client to allow customers to book travel packages across the world. The customer must be able to create and utilize an account, search/query various travel packages
by location and price point, and book reservations within the infrastructure. 

Software/Hardware: The software includes MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap (for resizing purposes). Back-end services include RESTful API and NoSQL Database System. Hardware will depend on the size
of the database. Cloud infrastructure may be present depending on client/organization needs.

Installation: The installation for the various can be found in the various location links below to use the various software:
Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/download
Visual Studio (HTML, CSS) - https://code.visualstudio.com/
MongoDB - https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/
Bootstrap (optional) - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/download/
Angular - https://angular.io/
Express: https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html

How-To-Use:
The application can be used by implementing the various functions including running through any web browser on the localhost:3000 for functional testing. The following application is still in the testing phase,
but can be run from the user folder after downloading the travlr.zip file provided through the GitHub link - https://github.com/oNeglect/CS-465. After downloading the zip folder, navigate to your user destination
within the command prompt/terminal for Windows, Mac terminal for Mac, and the shell for Linux using the cd ~. When you have reached that destination, download and initialize the node express web application using
the "npm install -g express-generator" command. Then generate the express web application using the "express --view=hbs --git --force" command. Next, launch the Visual Studio application and run npm install in the command terminal.
Lastly, run "SET DEBUG=travlr:*" and "npm start" respectively to start the webserver. Ensure you are running the terminal in administrator mode if it doesn't work the first time!
